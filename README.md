## üõ† Installation Guide

This mod requires [**BepInEx**](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/), a plugin framework for Unity games. The easiest way to get started is with the [**r2modman**](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) mod manager.

## üí° Troubleshooting

- **Mod not showing up in-game?**
  - Ensure all files are in the correct folders.
  - Confirm that r2modman installed the mod properly.

- **Game crashes after installing the mod?**
  - Try removing other mods to check for conflicts.
  - Make sure you're using the latest versions of **r2modman** and **BepInEx**.

- **üëï Character Clothing Notice**
   - Please note that **changing clothes/outfits does not work** with these custom characters.
   - These characters are based on **CC0 (Public Domain)** models, which means they were shared freely by artists for non-commercial and community use. The models have been adapted to work within *Bomb Rush Cyberfunk*, but their structure and mesh design do **not support outfit swapping** like the default in-game characters. Additionally, out of respect for the original creators and the nature of this project, I will **not be creating or modifying outfits** for these characters. They are meant to be played and enjoyed as they are ‚Äî true to the original CC0 designs, and as a celebration of community creativity.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Personal Shoutout

This mod ‚Äî and everything surrounding it ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt exist without the incredible support I‚Äôve received over the past year.

To everyone who‚Äôs watched my Twitch streams, shared ideas in Discord, dropped a follow, or simply shared a kind word:  
**Thank you from the bottom of my heart.**

Your support has helped me grow not just as a creator, but as a person.  
This journey has made me more confident, more open, and (yes) even helped me speak better English!

What started as a fun experiment has turned into a full-blown creative outlet ‚Äî and that‚Äôs thanks to YOU.

I‚Äôm beyond grateful for the energy you bring into my life.  
Let‚Äôs **MAKE THE INTERNET FUN AGAIN**
